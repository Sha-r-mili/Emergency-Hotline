Answers of the following questions:
   1. getElementById gives you one element by its unique ID, getElementsByClassName returns a live list of elements sharing a class, while querySelector and querySelectorAll let you grab elements using CSS selectors (the first match or all matches).

   2. To add something new to the page, you first create it with document.createElement(), set its text or attributes, then insert it into the DOM using methods like appendChild, prepend, or insertBefore.

   3. Event Bubbling means when you trigger an event on a child element (like a button), it doesn’t stop there—it travels up through its parent, then grandparent, all the way up to the document.

   4. Event Delegation takes advantage of bubbling by putting one event listener on a parent instead of many on the children, which saves memory, makes the code cleaner, and works even for elements added later.

   5. preventDefault() stops the browser’s built-in behavior (like following a link or submitting a form), while stopPropagation() stops the event from moving upward and triggering parent handlers.
